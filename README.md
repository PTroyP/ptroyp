## Hello!

My name is PTroyP, and I am pursuing a future in front-end development. This is my second (and last) career, so I'd better do it right!

## What I'm Currently Learning

I've just completed the Advanced HTML and CSS module. While I had done some work in HTML and CSS in the past, I really expanded my toolbox.

## What I've Done So Far
